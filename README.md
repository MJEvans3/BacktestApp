# Algorithmic Trading Backtest Dashboard

Welcome! This project is a full-stack web application designed for backtesting algorithmic trading strategies. It provides a dynamic and interactive interface to analyze the performance of various trading algorithms against historical market data.

This dashboard is built to showcase a comprehensive skillset in full-stack development, including backend and frontend technologies, API design, and data visualization.

## Project Overview

The application allows you to:
- **Select and Run Strategies**: Choose from a list of 9 pre-built trading strategies, ranging from simple moving average crossovers to more complex portfolio-based and machine learning models.
- **Customize Backtests**: Define the parameters for your backtest, including the stock tickers (or a portfolio of tickers) and the time period for the analysis.
- **Visualize Performance**: The dashboard presents the results through a series of interactive charts and key performance indicators (KPIs), including:
    - **Trade Signals & Indicators**: A detailed chart showing the stock's price, technical indicators, and the precise buy/sell signals generated by the strategy.
    - **Portfolio Growth**: A line chart illustrating the growth of your initial capital over the backtest period.
    - **Drawdown Chart**: A bar chart showing the percentage of capital loss from its peak.
    - **Performance Metrics**: Key metrics such as Total Return, Annualized Return, Sharpe Ratio, and Max Drawdown are displayed for a quick performance overview.

## Technical Architecture

This project is composed of a React frontend and a Python (Flask) backend, operating as follows:

-   **Frontend**: A responsive user interface built with **React** and **Vite**. It uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, **Recharts** for interactive data visualization, and **Lucide React** for icons. The frontend is responsible for capturing user inputs and displaying the backtest results in a clear and intuitive manner.

-   **Backend**: A RESTful API built with **Flask**. It serves as the core engine of the application and is responsible for:
    -   **Data Retrieval**: Fetching historical stock data using the `yfinance` library.
    -   **Backtesting Engine**: Leveraging the powerful `backtrader` library to run the trading simulations.
    -   **Strategy Implementation**: Contains the logic for all the trading strategies, which are implemented using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`.
    -   **API Endpoints**: Exposing endpoints for the frontend to fetch the list of strategies and to run backtests.

The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests, sending the backtest configuration and receiving the processed results for display.

## How to Use This Project

If you're visiting from my portfolio, you can simply follow the setup instructions below to run the project on your local machine. This will allow you to interact with the dashboard, run your own backtests, and explore the codebase to see how the different components work together.

This project can be used as a foundation for developing and testing your own trading ideas. You can easily extend it by:
- Adding new, custom trading strategies to the backend.
- Integrating different data sources.
- Enhancing the frontend with more advanced analytics and visualizations.

# Algorithmic Trading Backtest Dashboard - Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher) - [Download here](https://python.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## Project Structure

Create the following directory structure:

```
algorithmic-trading-backtest/
├── backend/
│   ├── flask.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   └── BacktestDashboard.jsx
│   │   ├── App.jsx
│   │   ├── main.jsx
│   │   └── index.css
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── vite.config.js
│   ├── tailwind.config.js
│   └── postcss.config.js
└── README.md
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Project Directory

```bash
mkdir algorithmic-trading-backtest
cd algorithmic-trading-backtest
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
# Create backend directory
mkdir backend
cd backend

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Move your flask.py file to this directory
```

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Go back to root directory
cd ..

# Create frontend directory
mkdir frontend
cd frontend

# Initialize npm project and install dependencies
npm install

# Move your backtest2.js file to src/components/BacktestDashboard.jsx
mkdir -p src/components
# Copy the content from backtest2.js to src/components/BacktestDashboard.jsx
```

### 4. File Placement

- Place `flask.py` in `backend/` directory
- Rename `backtest2.js` to `BacktestDashboard.jsx` and place in `frontend/src/components/`
- Create all the configuration files as shown in the artifacts above

### 5. Running the Application

#### Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd backend
# Activate virtual environment if not already active
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

python flask.py
```

The Flask API will start on `http://localhost:5000`

#### Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The React app will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 6. Testing the Application

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. You should see the Algorithmic Trading Backtest Dashboard
3. Select a strategy and stock symbol
4. Click "Run Backtest" to test the integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Make sure Flask-CORS is installed and configured
2. **Port Conflicts**: Change ports in vite.config.js if needed
3. **Python Dependencies**: Make sure all packages are installed correctly
4. **API Connection**: Verify Flask server is running on port 5000

### Environment Variables (Optional):

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Development Tips:

1. **Hot Reload**: Both servers support hot reload for development
2. **Error Checking**: Check browser console and terminal outputs for errors
3. **API Testing**: Test Flask endpoints directly with curl or Postman
4. **Dependencies**: Keep requirements.txt and package.json updated

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, you'll need to:
1. Build the React app: `npm run build`
2. Serve the built files with a web server
3. Configure Flask for production (WSGI server like Gunicorn)
4. Set up proper environment variables and security configurations

## Next Steps

Once everything is running:
1. Test all 9 trading strategies
2. Verify charts and metrics display correctly
3. Check error handling for invalid inputs
4. Consider adding more features like parameter tuning
